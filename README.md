# Milankovitch-Cycles-Animation
This repository contains code for an animation that visualizes the three Milankovitch Cycles (eccentricity, obliquity, and precession), as well as insolation. To run it, you will need to install the packages listed at the top of the milankovitch.py file. Please email danwexler32@gmail.com with any questions.
